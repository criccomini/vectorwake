# Build the Defold client.

# The simulation core is copied into the native extension rather than
# referenced, because Defold uploads an extension's directory to its build
# server and a symlink does not survive that trip. The copies are build
# artifacts: git ignores them, and this script refreshes them every run so
# they cannot drift from sim/.
